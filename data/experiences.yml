    description: <p>Along with base classes in <strong>math</strong>, <strong>logic</strong>,
      <strong>architecture</strong>, <strong>data structures</strong>, and <strong>algorithms</strong>,
      I focused&nbsp;on three "specialities" which I believe help prepare me as a
      Web Developer:&nbsp;<strong>Software</strong> <strong>Engineering </strong>(Agile/XP
      methodologies, project management, and testing), <strong>Database Technologies&nbsp;</strong>(underlying
      principles and emerging technologies)&nbsp;and <strong>AI </strong>(both Artificial
      Intelligence and Machine Learning).&nbsp;During my entire time at Georgia Tech,
      I worked at <a href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/">CareerBuilder.com</a> as
      a <a href="http://www.coop.gatech.edu/">co-operative student employee</a>.</p>
